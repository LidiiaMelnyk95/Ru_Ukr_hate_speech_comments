# Ru_Ukr_hate_speech_comments
The repository provides a list of the Ukrainian and Russian comments that were annotated on whether or not they can be classified as hate speech.

The corpus consists of 107 thousand unique comments split into 470 thousand sentences. Out of the entire corpus, 25% stem from korrespondent.net and 75% - from censor.net.
	Retrieved comment dates range between January 2019, the first mention of the new virus, and June 2021, the last update of the data. The comments cover the entire development of COVID-19 pandemics and, given the diversity of the sources and different target groups of the readers, can be considered representative of the general opinions in Ukrainian society. Korrespondent.net had a few hundred mentions of coronavirus from 2013-2016 sorted out, whereas censor.net for January and February 2020 could not be scrapped.

  The comments were annotated by the students of Lviv Polytechnic University.
Ten students volunteered to assist with the annotations. They were divided into pairs. Each pair worked simultaneously on a different set of annotations, equally divided in both Russian and Ukrainian.
The annotators followed the Fasttext friendly labeling:
'__LABEL__NO' for all the comments that do not have hate speech in it
'__LABEL__HATE' for data points that can be characterized as hate speech}
